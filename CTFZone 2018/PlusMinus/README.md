# Writeup

## About performance
The describing algorithm is polynomial asymptotic, so it's **very slow** and
because of timelimit exploit gets flag with some probability. The script should
be run on thread pool until flag is gotten.

## Design
### Recursion
Recursion is good enough to express algorithm that generates all valid expressions.
The arguments of recursive function: possible movements, count of unclosed
parenthesis, stack of unused numbers, current solution, needed value of expression.

### Base case
If the numbers stack is empty, we eval the current solution snd return
it if it's nearly equal to needed value of expression, otherwise return None.

### Movements
Valid movements: `['+', '-', '\*', '/', '(', "POP"]`. They describes what can we
do at this point of solving. There's no `)` because it isn't regular case, we
decide to put it basing on count of unclosed parenthesis. `POP` indicates we
can pop num from stack and put it at the end of solution.

### Priority order
I kept this putting order: `')', "POP", '+', '-', '\*', '/', '('`.`

The `(` is the least priority because we want to minimize length of finding solution.
The rest of priority order was chosen empirically.

### More micro optimizations
We shouldn't put `)` if the last put operator is `(`, because expressions like
`a + (b)` don't make much sense.

Also I denied generating expressions with nested parentheses. I hoped the
generating expressions by server wouldn't be much difficult. I was quite lucky, so I
got the flag after 2 hours running script in thread pool.

## Numbers format
The server sometimes sends numbers in specific format (e.g. `.0`) and
expects you send number back in the same format (not `0` or `0.`), so
you shouldn't lose original numbers.

## Exploit
[Here](./exploit.py) you can take a look at my exploit.

# Summary
I believe there's more optimal solution for this task. Algorithm that should be
run on thread pool doesn't seems like the best one.
